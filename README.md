## Unix-Shell-Scripting
One stop codeguide for getting started on unix shell scripting.  
The reposiory contains basic to intermediate working codes.
By studying these codes, you can get a working knowledge of unix shell scripting.  
These codes are not samples but actual code snippets that can be leveraged in projects.
Few examples of code are:  
1. Passing input variables to shell script.
2. Reading a file line by line.

### Steps to run.
